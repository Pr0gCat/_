# `_` - The Underscore Programming Language

Underscore is a __strong-typed hybird__ (Compiled, Interpreted and both) programming language, aims to be:
* High readability
* Simple but not basic
* Standalone
* Portable

## Current Progress?

We are under __bootstrapping__ stage.

## Conventions

Underscore had its own file types and conventions as shown below.

|File Type|Extension|
|-|-|
| Source code | `._`, `.us` or just `.u`|
| Markup | `.usml` |
| Object | `.uson` |
| Binary Object | `.uso` |

## Why `_`?

You hardly see a file that ends with `._`, and that make us really special!
